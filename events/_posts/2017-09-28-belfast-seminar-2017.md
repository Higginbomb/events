### U.S. Trade & Investment Growth Seminar in Belfast

On September 28, 2017, in Belfast, UK, SelectUSA and the U.S. Commercial Service will host the [U.S. Trade and Investment Growth Seminar](https://www.selectusa.gov/flyers/2017-belfast-seminar-agenda), designed to address questions from companies in the United Kingdom looking to enter or expand in the United States. 

In addition to an overview of the U.S. business environment, the program is centered on the following panels:

* _When and why should companies review their U.S. market plans?_
This panel will address current opportunities for Northern Ireland businesses to engage effectively in transatlantic trade and investment with the world’s largest economy. Attendees will hear from U.S. government representatives and business leaders on “why” and “when” to implement a U.S. growth plan.

* _Developing Your U.S. Market Entry Strategy – How did you do it?_
This panel will offer practical information on how to approach U.S. expansion. Panelists will discuss: the routes to market; legal, tax, accounting and insurance considerations; understanding federal and state support and incentives; choosing the right location; banking; and how to recruit and build the right U.S. team.
