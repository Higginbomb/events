SelectUSA will (again) be at the largest auto industry show in Canada!

The sixth edition of the SelectUSA Manufacturing Forum at the Canadian International Auto Show (CIAS) is set for February 16, 2017. Designed by the U.S. Commercial Service Toronto and in collaboration with SelectUSA, the Toronto event will feature companies from the Canadian automotive and advanced manufacturing technology sectors. U.S. economic development organizations (EDOs) will be able to meet with Canadian investors, hear about manufacturing from U.S. Government officials, and take advantage of networking opportunities.
