SelectUSA and the U.S. Commercial Service are joining forces to head the U.S. Trade & Investment Pavilion at [Cybertech 2017](http://www.cybertechisrael.com/), one of the top cyber technology trade shows in the world. The event will be held from January 29 - February 1, 2017, in Tel Aviv, Israel.

As an exhibition platform, the pavilion will provide U.S. economic development organizations (EDOs) with the opportunity to exhibit and promote their locations directly to Israeli and global tech companies looking to grow in the United States. 

By joining the U.S. Trade & Investment Pavilion, U.S. EDOs will not only receive assistance from SelectUSA and Commercial Service industry and investment experts; they will also have the chance to connect directly with high-level decision makers, participate in on-site visits, and forge international partnerships that benefit their regions, states, counties and cities.
