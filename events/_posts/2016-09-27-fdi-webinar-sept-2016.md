The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) recently released the [latest data on foreign direct investment](https://blog.trade.gov/2016/08/11/2015-a-banner-year-for-fdiintheusa/) (FDI) in the United States and found that, again, the United States is the top destination in the world for FDI. Among their findings:

* **6.4 million:** Number of U.S. jobs directly supported by FDI in 2014
* **$3.1 trillion:** Total FDI stock in the United States in 2015
* **$57 billion:** Value of R&D spending by U.S. affiliates of majority foreign-owned firms in 2014
* **$425 billion:** Total contribution to U.S. goods exports by majority foreign-owned firms in 2014
