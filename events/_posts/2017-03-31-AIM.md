SelectUSA is partnering with the U.S. Commercial Service to host the **U.S. Investment Pavilion** at the [2017 Annual Investment Meeting (AIM)](http://www.aimcongress.com/en/) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) on March 31 - April 4, 2017.

AIM is the region's first FDI-focused, emerging markets event. This year's theme, "International Investment, Path to Competitiveness & Development," is centered on FDI attraction strategies. Since its inception in 2011, AIM has brought together tens of thousands of exhibitors and visitors to network, promote projects and attract investment to their regions.
