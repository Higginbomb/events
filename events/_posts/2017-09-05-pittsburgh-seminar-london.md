### Pittsburgh Regional Alliance Seminar on the Future of Energy

On September 5, 2017, in London, UK, SelectUSA is supporting a [seminar](http://buyusa.gov/unitedkingdom/investinamerica/selectusaevents/index.asp#P29_520) examining how cities can create the future of energy by leveraging a bottom-up approach to tackling the dual challenges of energy development and immediate resiliency. Presented by the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance (PRA) in cooperation with the renowned University of Pittsburghâ€™s Center for Energy/Swanson School of Engineering, seminar will focus on how collaboration amongst academic, industry, and investment stakeholders can create and maintain new approaches to energy usage in cities and industries while producing economic development and preserving a commitment to environmental responsibility and sustainability.

The program includes experts from: Long Finance; World Energy Council; Economic Partnerships/University of Pittsburgh; and University of Pittsburgh Center for Energy
