The Gulf Coast Trade Alliance (GCTA), made up of members from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi, convenes business and industry leaders from the region to its annual World Trade Conference. This year, from April 3-6, the conference theme is ["Doing Business with Brazil"](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gulf-coast-trade-alliance-doing-business-with-brazil-tickets-30907092947), highlighting the bilateral trade relationship between Brazil and the United States.

SelectUSA's Deputy Director of Investment Services David Campbell will speak on April 4, providing attendees with information on the Memorandum of Understanding between SelectUSA and Apexbrasil and the services SelectUSA can offer Gulf Coast economic developers and Brazilian firms looking to enter the U.S. market.
