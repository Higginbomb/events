### Trade Windsâ€”Latin America Business Forum

The [Trade Winds-Latin America Business Development Conference and Trade Mission](http://2016.export.gov/tradewinds/), hosted by the U.S. Commercial Service, gives U.S. companies the opportunity to explore seven South American markets: Argentina; Bolivia; Chile; Mexico; Paraguay; Peru; and Uruguay. This year, U.S. economic development organizations (EDOs)  will have the opportunity to connect with business leaders, government  officials, and global investors in Santiago, Chile in a foreign direct investment-focused program. U.S. EDOs will have the chance to showcase their regions' investment opportunities to investors who are ready to do business.

EDOs are also welcome to attend optional trade mission stops in the other six markets.
