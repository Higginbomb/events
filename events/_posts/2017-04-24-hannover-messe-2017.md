[Hannover Messe](http://www.hannovermesse.de/home), the world's largest industrial technology trade show, is and has long been one of the premier event platforms to spark international business opportunities. The greatest and most-advanced manufacturing technologies are showcased and economic development growth is facilitated amongst 200,000 attendees, including members of the international business, manufacturing, and media communities. 

**On April 24-28, 2017, the Messe is back.**

The Pavilion will be located in Hall 3. The finalized price is 1150 euro per m2; inclusive of catering, stand construction, water, electricity, Wi-Fi, daily cleaning, and security.
